\abstract{%
  The GooFit highly parallel fitting package for GPUs and CPUs has been substantially upgraded in the past year. Python bindings have been added to allow simple access to the fitting configuration, setup, and execution. A Python tool to write custom GooFit code given a (compact and elegant) MINT3/AmpGen amplitude description allows the corresponding C++ code to be written quickly and correctly. New PDFs have been added. The most recent release was built on top of the December 2017 2.0 release that added easier builds, new platforms, and a more robust and efficient underlying function evaluation engine.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
High Energy Physics experiments around the world are producing record amounts of data. Existing tools, such as the RooFit fitting framework, provide flexible and powerful abstractions for building distributions to fit that data with, but this power comes at a cost; this is computationally expensive, and often only runs on a single core. Modern architectures provide many cores, as well as new computing paradigms, such as GPUs, that provide significant new potential for high performance computations, but are non-trivial for the physicst to use to build distributions in the description style familiar to him.

GooFit is a high-performance multi-thread and GPU ready framework providing a similar syntax to RooFit developed at the University of Cincinnati in 2013. (TODO: REF) It provided composition of model pieces in the same manor as RooFit, but was powered by GPUs. It also provided ready to use models The GooFit 2.0 release added a simpler build process, making it easy for users to pick up and run GooFit code.

\section{The New Indexing System}
\label{sec-ind}
The indexing system in GooFit needs to track the Variables and Observables used by any combination of PDFs by packing this information into four separate buffers. The primary index buffer provides either a constant integer value, or contains the index into one of the three subsequent buffers which contained events, parameters, or floating-precision constants\cite{GooFit}. For simple PDFs, performance is not an issue due to caching small chunks of memory. As more PDFs are involved in the fit, complexity is added causing memory accesses to approach random. For GPUs this is a problematic issue which causes a large overhead reading values back into memory due to the size of the L1 cache. Using the new indexing system improves this memory accessing pattern by having memory reads behave coherently. A side effect for coherent memory accesses is having the same value for a specific Variable or Observable duplicated, however the performance improvement at the cost of megabytes of memory but this has a larger impact on performance by providing a linear memory access for each PDF. 

The second improvement the indexing system provides is developing and testing PDFs as well by providing a method for testing that indices specific in PDF construction match with the device function. This makes tracking parameters that pass from the PDF class to the device function simpler to debug, and allows for simple tests when running in single thread single-core mode.

	\begin{tabular}{ |r|r|r| }
		\hline
			 & GooFit 2.0 (s) & GooFit 2.2 (s) \\
		\hline
			Dalitz [100,000 events] & 3.12221 & 1.70781 \\
		\hline
			Daltiz [10,000,000 events] & 317.347 & 130.282 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Performance comparisons of GooFit 2.0 versus GooFit 2.2 including the new indexing system.}
	\label{table:1}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:1} provides a performance comparison between the old indexing system in GooFit 2.0 and the new indexing system found in GooFit 2.2. The results show that providing more coherent memory reads improves the performance by a factor of 2.4 in the large event case, with a 82\% improvement with a small dataset.
